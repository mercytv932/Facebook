This project is a simple JavaScript login and authentication demo inspired by a basic social media system. It uses a hard-coded database of users with usernames and passwords, prompts the user to sign in through browser dialogs, and checks their credentials using JavaScript functions. If the login is successful, a sample news feed is displayed in the console; if not, the user receives an error alert. The project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts such as arrays of objects, loops, conditionals, functions, user input with prompt, and linking external JavaScript files to an HTML page.
